# Face-Detection-using-dlib

You can download the pretrained model to detect landmarks that used in the `shape_predictor()` method from [here](https://netix.dl.sourceforge.net/project/dclib/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2).

You can read about the HOG algorithm used to detect the face from [here](https://pyimagesearch.com/2014/11/10/histogram-oriented-gradients-object-detection/).
